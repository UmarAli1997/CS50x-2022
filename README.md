# CS50x 2022

This repo contains the beginning of my Software Engineering journey. It contains all my CS50x labs and problem sets from the 2022 syllabus.

Some of the things I learned from CS50x were:
  - Programming in C/Python/HTML/CSS/Javascript
  - Basic data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Hash Tables, Stack and Heap
  - Sorting Algorithms
  - The basics of Web Development, which is showcased in pset9 as a Stock Portfolio website with the ability to query stock prices, buy and sell stocks
